Mitochondria:
Membrane-bound cell organelles that generate most of the chemical
energy needed to power the cells biochemical reactions Chemical energy
Produced by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenoise
triphostate.
Cell Wall:
an outer layer is as outer layer surrounding certain cells that is outside of
the cell mombrune. All cells have cell membruines. Provides strength and support.
Nucleus:
where the DNA is kept and RNA is transcribed. RNA is moved out of the
nucleus thromah muclear pores. The nucleous is usually visible as a darle
Spot in the nucleus, and the location of ribosome formation.
Cytoplasm:
material between the plasma membrane (tell mebrane) and the nuclear envelope.
Fibroous proten tims that occur in the musies skeletal System main the Shape of the
cello
Vacuoles:
Single membrane organelles that are essentially part of the antside that
is located within the cell. The sinde membrane is known in the Valvole.
